# nand2tetris

## Resource

You can find the tutorials and tools on the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course) project website.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to learn how computer hardware work.
Starting with only a nand gate we build up other logical gates.
From then on, each chapter introduces new concepts up to a full computer. Once the computer ready, we switch to software with high level language and OS.
